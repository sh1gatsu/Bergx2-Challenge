**The challenge**

Here is a list of what I have implemented:

0) Rewrite the application to typescript if you can do it. ✔

1) Sort fetched items and form 2 lists, ✔

 - first list should stay untouched ✔

 - children items in second list should be connected to their parents and rendered recursively (see list.jpg), create a function and form a tree for it ✔

2) Try to optimize application as much as possible ✔

3) There is only one action, add missing actions for loading/error while fetching items from the server ✔ 
(probably 50/50 cause i implemented logic that i guess is right for loading/error states, but probably i need to do it using redux that i still dont know well, but I'll keep going in it :))

4) Extra points for adding eslint ✔

5) Extra point for adding unit tests ✔

To run this app on your device, you need:
1) check node version, it should be 14.18.2 !!!!!!!!
(to watch your current version pls type 'node -v' in console)
2) write npm i to install all needed packages !
3) write npm start to start local server !

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start, npm run deploy, npm install, npm test`
